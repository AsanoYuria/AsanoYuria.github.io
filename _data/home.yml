#      - title: Time-varying formation tracking control problems for multi-agent systems using distributed multi-sensor multi-target filtering are investigated. In order to obtain the accurate state estimations of targets, a distributed multi-sensor multi-target filtering algorithm based on the cubature Kalman filter scheme and multiple heterogeneous sensors is proposed. Then, the state estimations obtained by the filtering algorithm are used to design a time-varying formation tracking protocol for multi-agent systems, enabling these systems to form a time-varying formation and track the convex combination of multiple targets. The estimation errors of filtering algorithm are proved to be bounded by introducing a stochastic process and the boundedness of the formation tracking errors is further proved by using the properties of the Laplacian matrix. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by simulation experiments.

#      - title: This paper focuses on a distributed event-triggered Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filtering algorithm. With this algorithm, sensors transmit their Gaussian components to their neighbors  basing on the event-triggering conditions, and finally perform certain times fusion by matrix reformulation. The existence of the upper bound of the filtering error covariance is proved and the upper bound can be minimized by designing the filtering parameter at each time instant properly. This algorithm can reduce data transmission and energy consumption significantly without compromising the expected estimation performance. Simulation experiment evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm.

#      - title: Formation tracking is used widely in targets enclosing, monitoring and striking, however, in practical scenes, the targets are always uncooperative. In this paper, the problem of time-varying formation tracking for multiagent with multi-target which states are unknown is studied. In order to obtain the accurate state estimations of targets, a distributed multi-sensor multi-target filtering algorithm based on the cubature Kalman filter scheme and multiple heterogeneous sensors is proposed. Then, the state estimations obtained by the filtering algorithm are used to design a time-varying formation tracking protocol for multiagent, enabling multiagent to form a time-varying formation and track the convex combination of targets.
