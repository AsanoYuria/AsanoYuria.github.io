Attending the 2023 Goldman Sachs APAC Women's Trader Academy was an enriching and exhilarating experience. The comprehensive three-day event offered a remarkable immersion into the fast-paced world of trading, providing valuable insights and fostering my growing interest in the field.

On Day 1, the organizers ignited our curiosity and demonstrated why it's exciting to be a trader at GS. The trading floor tour was a real eye-opener, showing us the high-stakes and fast-paced environment where every decision counts. Additionally, the group project and networking receptions offered us a valuable opportunity to engage with industry experts, which significantly expanded our understanding of the trading landscape.

Day 2 transitioned into a more academic focus. Held virtually, it was dedicated to equipping us with practical skills and theoretical knowledge through vendor-led training and trading simulation. I found this day particularly illuminating. The simulation of real-time trading scenarios deepened my understanding of market dynamics and decision-making processes.

The third and final day was an opportunity to showcase what we had learned. Despite the high-pressure environment of the market making game and group project presentation, I found it to be an exciting challenge that brought out the best in me. It was rewarding to see how much I had absorbed over the preceding days.

Though I learned a lot during the event, it also underscored the vast amount of professional knowledge I still need to familiarize myself with. Moving forward, I plan to delve deeper into different trading types and processes, as I believe they will be instrumental not only in my career in the financial sector but also in personal investment decisions.

The experience further cemented my interest in the finance industry, particularly in the trading sector. The exposure, learnings, and connections I've gained at GS were invaluable. I'm hopeful for another opportunity to visit the Goldman Sachs office and to continue broadening my horizons in the fascinating world of trading.
