Also in collaboration with Dr. Xin Jiang, this project focuses on multi-domain asynchronous federated learning. The challenge lies in the difficulty of collecting data and the necessity to protect user privacy. Federated learning enables user devices to perform local training while maintaining privacy, and a parameter server is used to aggregate and refine the global model.

Data independence and domain gaps/shifts are present in this context, leading to asynchronous updates when data is uploaded to the server. The proposed solution is a multi-domain asynchronous federated learning server. In this asynchronous approach, nodes upload at different times, allowing the server to perform asynchronous fusion based on the currently available data.

The method employed is an asynchronous federated learning fusion algorithm, which addresses the challenges of multi-domain asynchronous learning. During training, the parameters uploaded by each node may be biased if optimized in different directions. Simple weighted averaging for aggregation may not yield satisfactory fusion results. The solution considers that regardless of the domain, some consensus features can be extracted, akin to the idea of truth discovery. The algorithm processes the data from each node's parameters and identifies common features among the uploaded parameters to serve as the fusion result.

Experiments were conducted using the digit-five dataset. Multi-domain data was generated using domain augmentation techniques, and style-transfer methods were employed, creating the digit-style dataset. The DomainNet dataset is still being used for training.

In summary, this project proposes an algorithm to address the challenges of multi-domain asynchronous learning in computer vision and machine learning by identifying consensus features among the uploaded parameters to serve as the fusion result. The experiments involve the digit-five, digit-style, and DomainNet datasets.
